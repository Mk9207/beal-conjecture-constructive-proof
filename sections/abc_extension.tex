\section{Extension of ABC Model}
\begin{lemma}
Let \( A^x + B^y = C^z \) with no common factor. Then this violates the generalized ABC bound in the exponent space.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply the extended ABC structure: large exponents with coprime bases imply radical inequality violations, leading to contradiction.
\end{proof}
